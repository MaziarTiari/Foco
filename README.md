### A project management tool

## Logic
#### Goals
A goal is like its name already defines, something you want to reach or achieve. It is the root of every task.
#### Project
Every goal can have different projects. A project has one or many tasks and three different views in wich you can create, edit and delete the tasks in this project.
#### Tasks
A task can have a todolist, priority (low, middle, high), a state (todo, in progress, done), and attachments like urls or files.

## Feature
### Different views
#### Home
In the home view you can see, create, edit and delete goals and projects in you goals

#### Board View
Here you have a Kanban board, where you can move the tasks of a selected project in different states, such as todo, in progress, review, done...

#### List View
Every task in your projects can have a todolist. In the List view you can see all of your tasks in the selected project, each of them with its own todolist, attachments etc.

#### Calendar
Every task can have a deadline, here you have a calendar where you can see the tasks in the selected project which have a deadline.
You can here also edit, and delete a project or just reschedule the deadline.
